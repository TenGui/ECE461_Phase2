# Instructions to compile and run
1: type 'tsc' to terminal.
    - This will create a 'dist' folder by compiling all .ts files. Dist folder
    is not to be commited onto github as it consists of executable files.
    When compiling typescript files, they are converted to .js files first.

2: type 'node .\dist\github.js'
    - This will run the compiled .js file named github.js. You can change the 
    executable accordingly.
